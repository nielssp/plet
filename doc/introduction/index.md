## Introduction

Plet is a flexible static site generator, web framework, and programming language.
Static websites (or [static web pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page)) are collections of HTML files and assets that are served exactly as they are stored on the web server. This provides better security, performance, and stability.

**Warning: Plet is work in progress and may change at any time.**
